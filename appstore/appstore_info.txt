Tap, swipe, or shake to see different shapes and colors.

* Swipe in different directions to get squares, rectangles, triangles, circles, or ellipses.
* Tap or shake to get a random shape.
* Two-touch tap to toggle the grid on and off.

One thing I've noticed is that most TV shows, online cartoons, and apps that teach shapes
 have a lot of 'noise' -- animations, sound effects, and worst of all, pop-up advertisements. As a parent, 
 I value something a bit more understated, simple, and most of all, quiet :).

You supply the soundtrack by looking at shapes with your child, asking them questions about them, and pointing out their 
dimensions, orientations and colors. The triangle shapes are especially interesting, as the random combinations go 
beyond the simple "equilateral triangle with its base parallel to the bottom of the screen," so kids can learn to 
recognize them in different orientations.
